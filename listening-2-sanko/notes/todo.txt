notes about media upload
  kind of redundant to have 4 instance of the uploadorlink component for each state
  audio/visual
  link/upload/select

  let's have a showSelectMedia state
  let's also have writable stores for these values

  export let selectType = writable<'audio' | 'visual'>('visual');
  export let selectMode = writable<'upload' | 'link' | 'select'>('select');

this way i can have 1 component for the uploadorlinkmodal and then from within the modal we can change to link/upload/select


🪲 handle remove media
🪲 enable audio selection
  updated functions
  need to implement similar logic to the video selections
  make sure notification sound ends when alert ends
🪲 destroy prev audio when new plays
🪲 refactor update function to apply sound to the alert sound
  change the type and the default alert
  make sure that the update function targets that
!TODO enable audio link + upload
  audio upload needs to go the to the db,
  be handled as a mediaItem


idea i need to jot
modal in
tabs fly in 1 by 1 at increasings speeds with backout easing

everything still works except for the 
  animation presets
  upload audio
  weight doesnt show?
  sliders dont show current number until update function is called
  link audio? do people even use link audio?
    links are common for images but probably not audio
once i get this working then i can keep at the websocket and figure out how to handle it for multiple users

get rid of fonts that don't work
get more fonts that do work
