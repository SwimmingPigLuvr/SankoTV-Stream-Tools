notes about media upload
  kind of redundant to have 4 instance of the uploadorlink component for each state
  audio/visual
  link/upload/select

  let's have a showSelectMedia state
  let's also have writable stores for these values

  export let selectType = writable<'audio' | 'visual'>('visual');
  export let selectMode = writable<'upload' | 'link' | 'select'>('select');

this way i can have 1 component for the uploadorlinkmodal and then from within the modal we can change to link/upload/select


handle remove media
enable audio selection
destroy prev audio when new plays
enable audio link + upload
refactor update function to apply sound to the alert sound
  change the type and the default alert
  make sure that the update function targets that
