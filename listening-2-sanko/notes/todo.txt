notes about media upload
  kind of redundant to have 4 instance of the uploadorlink component for each state
  audio/visual
  link/upload/select

  let's have a showSelectMedia state
  let's also have writable stores for these values

  export let selectType = writable<'audio' | 'visual'>('visual');
  export let selectMode = writable<'upload' | 'link' | 'select'>('select');

this way i can have 1 component for the uploadorlinkmodal and then from within the modal we can change to link/upload/select
