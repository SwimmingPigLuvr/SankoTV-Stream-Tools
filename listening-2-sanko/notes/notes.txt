july 8 sanko day
tts is playing 2x
    the voice is different both times so it must have been called twice
real zyn donation not working just the test
need a better video
text should die after it is read
use a better video / animation

ideas:
    ways sanko users can interact
    buy pass / sell pass
    mint donations
    chat
    watch

what can we control
    emoji widget
    donation widget
    chat widget

donation alert

    chime is important.
    it sounds nice and the user will like to hear it
    also the user will like to see their name onscreen

    {user}
    donated {quantity} {gift}!
    custom message

    need to change the data to get the name quantity and gift
    actually no, this can be separate from the tts



checklist

donations
    ðŸ’Žui flex wrap
    format plural messages
    trigger accurate alert with sound
        implement muting
    implement img upload
    implement custom layout
    message template info on hover
    background color info on hover

    add sections
        sounds
        animations




july 21

axis needs to be x or y
easing selection makes correct change but value does not reflect in ui
duration number is weird to edit. can't type in 1000. 
    because the 0 just sits there so i end up having to do 
    01000
    also can't input negative numbers but i can just hold the down arrow and lower the number 1 by 1

july 22

changing 1 param sets the rest of the params to the default values
    there should be an easily fixable error in the update function
