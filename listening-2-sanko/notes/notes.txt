july 8 sanko day
tts is playing 2x
    the voice is different both times so it must have been called twice
real zyn donation not working just the test
need a better video
text should die after it is read
use a better video / animation

ideas:
    ways sanko users can interact
    buy pass / sell pass
    mint donations
    chat
    watch

what can we control
    emoji widget
    donation widget
    chat widget

donation alert

    chime is important.
    it sounds nice and the user will like to hear it
    also the user will like to see their name onscreen

    {user}
    donated {quantity} {gift}!
    custom message

    need to change the data to get the name quantity and gift
    actually no, this can be separate from the tts



checklist

donations
    ðŸ’Žui flex wrap
    format plural messages
    trigger accurate alert with sound
        implement muting
    implement img upload
    implement custom layout
    message template info on hover
    background color info on hover

    add sections
        sounds
        animations




july 21

axis needs to be x or y
easing selection makes correct change but value does not reflect in ui
duration number is weird to edit. can't type in 1000. 
    because the 0 just sits there so i end up having to do 
    01000
    also can't input negative numbers but i can just hold the down arrow and lower the number 1 by 1

july 22

changing 1 param sets the rest of the params to the default values
    there should be an easily fixable error in the update function

list of saved alert names & create alert button


notes july 25

reconnect to wallet when applicable
    put this in the layout so that it functions in the entire project

when editing i need to be able to go back to the homepage

so let's make a directory component that can sit on the left side of the sreen
or on mobile it can be a modal that takes up the screen and otherwise is hidden
keep the ui the same as the dashboard

darkmode toggle can be out in the open on simple pages like the homepage but otherwise let's have it in a menu

figure out how to save the users' data

dashboard rn:
    directory with completely blank screen on the right hand side
    maybe dir can be in the middle with centered text then once a page is opened we scoot it to the left

dashboard pages
    dir left, content right
    on small screen hide the dir


create new alert
    goto donation-alerts/+page.svelte
    prompt user to name alert then save to db


todo create user doc in db
trim unnecessary items from folder

july 30 notes

spent the morning coding at anns and it was very relaxing and peaceful. 
that lazy boy is ideal for having my feet up but still being up right

the key takeaways

need traditional auth to add users to my supabase db
going to use google because it is probably the most common denominator
besides sanko.tv uses a normal auth along with a wallet.

so here's how it looks like:
users auth with google => account gets created in the db
users connect their wallet => can start saving data in db

right now my supabase and google are already set up for success i just need to refactor my code to do this new auth flow

walletstores.ts should be refactored
components should be made where necessary

my typing feels slow so im going to practice a bit 


well i have the google sign in working.

so now we have some questions / decisions to make about ux

go straight to dashboard?
or show a dashboard button? i think show a dashboard button so they know
what the f is happening.




need to dump some thoughts so that i can handle the outline of the homepage ux

if $user
    show:
    dashboard button
    signout button
else
    show:
    google sign in

signout button should just live in the google auth component

so google auth is always shown so it looks like

if $user
    show:
    dashboard button
else
    dont show:
    dashboard button

google auth component

save the connect button for the wallet auth because i really like the way i designed it


				<!-- connect wallet -->
					<button
						in:slide={{
							easing: backOut,
							delay: 1000,
							duration: 1000,
						}}
						class="transform transition-all duration-100 ease-[backOut] border-blue-700 border-[1px] {$isDarkMode
							? 'text-white hover:bg-blue-900'
							: 'text-blue-700 bg-white hover:bg-blue-700 hover:text-white'} font-serif italic p-2 -tracking-wider px-4 rounded-full"
						on:click={() => (showGoogleAuthButton = true)}
						disabled={isConnecting}
					>
						{isConnecting ? "Connecting..." : "Connect"}
					</button>

				    if connected
					<!-- wallet address + disconnect button -->
					<div
						in:fly={{ y: -10 }}
						class="rounded-full w-48 flex justify-between space-x-4 items-center {$isDarkMode
							? 'bg-blue-700'
							: 'bg-blue-300 text-slate-800'} px-4 p-2 font-mono text-xs -tracking-widest"
					>
						<button class="">
							{truncatedAddress}
						</button>
						<button
							class="font-bold"
							on:click={() => walletStore.disconnect()}
						>
							Disconnect
						</button>
					</div>

we don't need to show the user a sign out button asap

so how about we have some sort of acknowledgment that they're signed in

if authed by google but no wallet and or username

signed in as {username ? username : 'anon'}
if wallet.address
    trucated address + disconnect button
if no wallet.address
    connect button

instead of making the user go to the dashboard we should get their wallet right away

need to change the connect functions because the wallet is NOT handling supabase auth!

also need to edit the auth policies because the wallet should be connected to the right address on the user account

so google creates auth.uid (main auth for supabase user)
wallet_address validates that they are allowed to make changes
both need to be true
 
8:44pm
test a new layout option
heres the old one so i don't lose it
<script>
	import Directory from "$lib/components/Directory.svelte";
</script>

<main class="flex justify-between w-full">
	<div class="fixed w-1/4">
		<Directory />
	</div>
	<div class="ml-auto w-full md:w-3/4">
		<slot />
	</div>
</main>

great work today. let's keep it up

for tomorrow:

make the mobile look nice and organized
finish the db setup: blank data obj etc.

july 31

directory on mobile:
    if url is dashboard/donation-alerts
	if isMobile
	    the menu button should appear 
	    the directory should be able to be toggled
	else if notMobile

august 1st notes
  
walletauth flow

need to ask which account to signin
if i click disconnect that means i expect to be disconnected.
right now if i connect again it will instantly show that we are connected to the last wallet which should not be true
hide disconnect button after a second or two

implement total light and dark modes

users are in with google so let's start getting some data

show that features are coming soon so that i can ship an MVP

fix the hover button ui for the directory it feels weird

something simple like a star that appears would even work

we can make the directory way skinnier


august 2nd

focus:
make sure auth is flawless
make sure db access is flawless
make sure ui is flawless

right now we ahve placeholder data that needs to be the user's data
the placeholder data right now is just two objects with name fields

we need to have the relevant data to each section
sorting them by name


user gets to dashboard clicks donation alerts create new then is 
prompted to name it then it's saved as a default alert in the db then it can be edited and all changed instantly save to the db

new alerts are looking good

successfully added to the db instantly nice nice
showing in the directory --- taking a little too long so let's make that instant
need to show the user that we have the correct alert loaded as soon as we get to the donation-alerts page

O

let's get the directory list updated instantly and the name in the alert config showing sf





august 10
6:07pm

need to have different ui for /dashboard/donation-alerts
when no alert is specified

create components for the donation alert config ui

make sure the changes save to the db!


use the update function and create a toast noti to show what is changed


do the changes update the db irt


right now the default font size is 32px

when i set a new value it displays as 38pxpx

so i need to use the users db value as the value displayed on the input right away

i see the issue. when the page is refreshed the currentalert store is not existent. so on mount should fetch the users data if not fetches already

make name editable
sync all inputs with user data
clean up the toast notifications
use the debounce especially for input types like range sliders

display correct percentage for volume
make sure font size doesn't say 'pxpx'

create a send to stream button to test out the alerts

working on the database right now so that the user can edit and add data seamlessly! let's go

right now i find it annoying that the alert title says undefined when the pagerefreshes so let's add a loading state?
if data {
    data
} else {
    ðŸª²
}

todo
go down the list and just make everything work well
this means implementing the image / sound uploads too
update the updateconfig to simply add a new alert or update the existing alert 
there is no need to reqrite the entire array
add delete buttons to manage alerts


fist step is refactoriong the updatealertconfig to use the simpler update methods on the datastore
    that was super easy not hard at all took 2s

ui issues
    right now the create new modal shows up before the donation-alerts page is reached so it jumps around a bit. let's go to donation-alerts then show the modal

let's go through the list one at a time

make the name editable
the problem with the current setup is that is only edits the config fieldd so it adds name: newName to the config field
but i want to edit the name field that is above the config
super easy fix. i just needed to actually call the function because i nailed it the first time i just never even called it

i need to add a new data field for whether or not the alert is even turned on
it should be at teh top level with id, name, and config
    

when i made a new alert the alert name was undefined until i refreshed...

the delete method deletes the store but it is immediate revived by the store value

why doesnt the isActive field get populated for the coffee alert data???????
make sure that isActive displays the correct data from the db in the ui
make sure that the toast displays the change

boom all those are done that was easy.

refactor the toasts for different data types
updates should be a positive change,
deletions should be a negative change,
major updates should be distinct:
name, isActive

also make sure that the toast notis stack and debounce so that they don't flood the screen 
also have a limit on the height with an overflow of y auto and x hidden so that the user can scroll through them all

add the data field for the specific gift on the donation alerts
also make sure that the triggers are saved to the db and updated correctly and toasted

definitely need custom toasts for the updates on the triggers
they are way too custom to match the template of the other ones

here again reminding myself to do custom toasts

remove image should edit the layout
we can just set it to image above text

link / upload widgets
create modal
use a store for the link
save that to user's data
mediaSrc: link | storage
create storage bucket for uploaded media

need to make the modal the highest z index

need to plan how i plan toachieve hte widget in the users stream
should be a url that seems the easiest

select image ui
be able to change tabs once modal is open
seamlessly switch between link/upload/select
select can even auto hold all of the previous links and uploads
sounds on hover? especially elements that grow

todo
handle videos as donation alerts
fix animations in
create image upload logic
create storage for images
create storage limit for users
create sound selections
